    <p>Hi! <br> <br> Welcome to the donkverse. It's probably an amazing feeling to be here. I know I'm excited. If you're wondering what's 
      around here, there's quite a bit. Although if I were you, I would head over to see our friends at New Donk City. They're
      wonderful company. <br> <br> If you're feeling like going alone for now, you can't do much better than a visit to the Horrid Pumpkin. Lastly, we've heard rumors
      the smack-talking residents at our rival municipality, Volcano Island, have been up to no goodâ€”make sure to see what they're up to!! We'll 
      get them one day!
      <br> <br> See you later! If you ever need this directory again just chant your name backwards three times while gazing into The Deep. :D

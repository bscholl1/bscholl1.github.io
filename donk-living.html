    <h1>Life in New Donk City</h1>

	<p class = "center">  New Donk City's map is not only historically acurate, but infallible as well.</p>
	<br>

    <p>NEW DONK CITY is the NEWLY founded city-state
      located in Kansas, Missouri. The city was 
      instantiated.<small>object</small> by Zuggernot Appleton 
      and Dr. Cambridge Hammystam in <strong>1438</strong> and 
      features unparalleled residential life, 
      jaw dropping entertainment, and gracious style(). 
      NDC is ranked as America’s 42nd most affluent city, 
      crowning it as the business capital of the world.

    <p>
      Commerce flourishes in New Donk 
      (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/realestate/the-financial-district-a-tourist-magnet-with-a-village-like-quality.html" target="_blank">New Donk Business Life</a>). 
      Residents arise from 
      their diamond encrusted apartments revelling in how 
      <strong>painfully apparent</strong> their wealth is. 
    </p>
    <p>OUTRAGEOUS.</p>
    <p>LOVABLE.</p>

      New Donk City and the heartwarming spell it weaves over its 
      inhabitants. As the famed New Donkian philosopher Remmington.exe once stated,
      <b><i>“New Donk City is where I am right now.”</b></i>

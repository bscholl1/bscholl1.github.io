    <h1>Life in New Donk City</h1>

	<p class = "center">  New Donk City's map is not only historically acurate, but infallible as well.</p>
	<br>

    <p>NEW DONK CITY is the NEWLY founded city-state
      located in Kansas, Missouri. The city was 
      instantiated.<small>object</small> by Zuggernot Appleton 
      and Dr. Cambridge Hammystam in <strong>1438</strong> and 
      features unparalleled residential life, 
      jaw dropping entertainment, and gracious style(). 
      NDC is ranked as America’s 42nd most affluent city, 
      crowning it as the business capital of the world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Commerce flourishes in New Donk. 
      Residents arise from 
      their diamond encrusted apartments revelling in how 
      <strong>painfully apparent</strong> their wealth is. 
    </p>
    <p>OUTRAGEOUS.</p>
    <p>LOVABLE.</p>
    <p>These two words serve as the fundamental cornerstone of 
      New Donk City and the heartwarming spell it weaves over its 
      inhabitants. As the famed New Donkian philosopher Remmington.exe once stated,
      <b><i>“New Donk City is where I am right now.”</b></i>
    </p>
    <p>Have any words been more true? If you answered, <strong>“YEAH”</strong> then NDC is the place for you.

    <h1>The New Donk Agenda</h1>

    <p>
      New Donk City. Like every municipality, it stands monument to values of a few daring builders:
      <ul>
        <li>Gilbert Pinkiethumb (may exist in reality)—Hitting my macros</li>
        <li>Master Headzorber (may he rest in peace)—Life above</li>
        <li>Third (wanted)—Intellectual property</li>

      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>

      These are our valuesThese are our values. 
      In the words of our favored son, Doorjamb Collision, 
      “NDC points less to the past...and more to a chromium plated, 
      beverage-wealthy future. The citizens know they are parents 
      of future New Donk and comport themselves with dignity, 
      leading lives in accordance with their prosperity.” With this in mind: 
      <ol>
      <li> There are to be no open-toed shoes within the city limits.</li> 
      <li> Advertisement which does not include explicit reference 
      toward the products being advertised is strictly prohibited, and will result in 10 months.</li> 
      <li>Persons beneath the age of someone are to be monitored at all times and allowed party-access!</li>
      <li>There is no consumption of any and all electronic devices. Forbidden actually prohibited. Hitherto their own. </li>
      <li>Individuals with snake ownership must never bend straws and must posses a liscense for snake ownership at all 
        times, never bending straws. Termination of this law will result in abrasion. </li>
      <li>Citizens aren’t to hold any unwanted/restricted parties. Any unwanted/forbidden 
        party reports may be used against you by assailants in court.</li>
      </ol>

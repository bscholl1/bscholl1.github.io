    <h1>The New Donk Agenda</h1>
	<br>
	<br>

    <p>
      New Donk City. Like every municipality, it stands monument to values of a few daring builders:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gilbert Pinkiethumb</strong> (<i>may he exist in reality</i>)—Hitting my macros</li>
        <li><strong>Master Headzorber</strong> (<i>may he rest in peace</i>)—Life above</li>
		<li><strong>Third</strong> (<i>wanted</i>)—Intellectual property</li><strong>

      </strong></ul>

      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>

      These are our valuesThese are our values. 
      In the words of our favored son, Doorjamb Collision, 
	  “NDC points less to the past...and more to a chromium plated, 
      beverage-wealthy future. The citizens know they are parents 
      of future New Donk and comport themselves with dignity, leading lives in accordance with their prosperity.”
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <strong>With this in mind: THE RULES</strong>   :
      <ol>
		<li> There are to be <b>NO</b> open-toed shoes within the city limits.</li> 
		<li> Advertisement which does not include explicit reference 
          toward the products being advertised is strictly <b>PROHIBITED</b>, and will result in 10 months.</li> 
		<li>Persons beneath the age of someone are to be monitored at all times and <b>ALLOWED PARTY-ACCESS!</b></li>
		<li>There is no consumption of any and all electronic devices. <b>FORBIDDEN PROHIBITED.</b> Hitherto their own. </li>
		<li>Individuals with a snake license will <b>NEVER</b> bend straws. Refusal of this law will result in denial. </li>
		<li>Citizens <b>AREN'T</b> to hold any restricted parties. Forbidden party reports may be used against you in court.</li>
		<li>Have a <b>NICE</b> day! :D</li>
      </ol>
